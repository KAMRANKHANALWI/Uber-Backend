# Uber Backend Project

This project is a backend implementation of an Uber-like ride-booking application using **Spring Boot**. It allows users to book rides online, providing a complete flow from ride requests by riders to ride acceptance by drivers, and payment processing via wallets.

## **Project Overview**

### **Key Features:**
- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Implemented using Spring Security with JWT-based authentication.
  
- **Ride Booking Workflow:**
  - Rider requests a ride.
  - Available drivers are located using a **strategy design pattern**, optimizing ride allocation and reducing waiting times by up to 50%.
  - Driver accepts the ride.
  - Payment is processed using an integrated wallet system.
  
- **Admin Panel:**
  - Provides control over riders and drivers.
  - View and manage rides and payments.

- **RESTful APIs:**
  - OpenAPI documentation is provided for easy API testing and integration.

- **Database Integration:**
  - PostgreSQL used for data persistence.
  - JPA and Hibernate Spatial for geolocation-based operations.

## **Spring Boot Concepts Covered**

The project incorporates the following key Spring Boot concepts:

1. **Spring Boot Starter Web:**
   - Develop RESTful APIs and handle HTTP requests efficiently.

2. **Spring Boot Starter Security:**
   - Secure endpoints with JWT authentication and authorization.

3. **Spring Boot Starter Data JPA:**
   - Perform CRUD operations using JPA and PostgreSQL.

4. **Spring Boot Starter Actuator:**
   - Monitor and manage application health and performance.

5. **ModelMapper:**
   - Simplify object mapping between DTOs and entities.

6. **Hibernate Spatial:**
   - Handle geolocation-based queries efficiently.

7. **Exception Handling:**
   - Implemented using `@ControllerAdvice` for centralized exception management.

## **System Design Overview**

### **Database Schema**

#### Entities:
1. **Rider:** Stores user profile, ride history, and wallet balance.
2. **Driver:** Stores driver profile, availability status, and vehicle details.
3. **Ride:** Tracks ride requests, status, and payment details.
4. **Wallet:** Handles balance and transaction history.

### **Flow of the Backend System**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Riders and drivers authenticate using JWT-based security.

2. **Ride Request Flow:**
   - Rider sends a ride request via API.
   - A suitable driver is identified using the **strategy design pattern.**
   - Notification is sent to the driver.

3. **Ride Acceptance:**
   - Driver accepts the ride request.
   - Ride status is updated in the database.

4. **Payment Handling:**
   - Rider's wallet balance is deducted.
   - Payment records are stored.

5. **Admin Monitoring:**
   - Admin can view all ride and payment details via API.

## **Design Patterns Used**

1. **Strategy Design Pattern:**
   - Used to dynamically select the best ride-matching algorithm based on factors like driver availability, distance, and rider preferences.

2. **Singleton Pattern:**
   - Ensures a single instance of services like ride-matching and payment processing.
